# So this is basically ANOVA but using a line so all the same assumptions hold....
# But additionally we need to know if the data are linearly structured...to do this well make a picture


# Load compensation.csv datafile from Beckerman and Petchey's book.....see readings
Growth <- read.csv(file.choose())

# Look at the file
Growth
# and its structure
str(Growth)

# read in grazing as a character variable. Better used as a factor
Growth$Grazing <- as.factor(Growth$Grazing)
#We can introduce a new way of looking at the data files using the glimpse function (from Tidyverse in the dplyr library)

library(tidyverse)
glimpse(-------) # Fill in the correct object name.....!!!!
glimpse(Growth)
# now let's plot it using R base plot() function; we're interested in knowing whether
# Root biomass (Root) has an influence or correlates with Fruit production (Fruit)

plot(Growth$Root, Growth$Fruit)
# Notice we're using the filename and $ operator to indicate the variables and that Y (response variable comes last)

# A better and more intuitive way to do it uses the data = argument

plot(Fruit ~ Root, data = Growth) # This fits the model specification for aov and linear models

# so we can see that the relationship looks linear! But also that it has two components.
# Let's tidy it up (or pimp it as Beckerman and Petchey would say)

# Add some axis labels and you can vary their size using the list(cex combination of arguments)
plot(Fruit ~ Root, data = Growth,
	xlab = list("Root Biomass",cex = 1.5), # add half to the size of the default font
	ylab = list("Fruit Production",cex = 0.5)) # halves the default font

# Now let's consider the points on the graph
# ?par gives you help on the graphics parameters
# ?points specifically on the points.

plot(Fruit ~ Root, data = Growth,
	xlab = list("Root Biomass",cex = 1), # reset size to default of 1
	ylab = list("Fruit Production",cex = 1), # reset size to default of 1
	cex = 2, pch = 21, bg = "grey") # the pch argument controls the type 21 = filled circle, bg = colour.

# You can see that there are two clusters of points here relating to the treatment - so let's explore that.
# It would be instructive to give them different colours to illustrate the patterns.

# First let's create an object that tags the colours using an ifelse() function = if / else

culr <- ifelse(Growth$Grazing == "Grazed", "green", "blue")

#look at it
culr

# to add the colours just substitute the object name into the colour argument
plot(Fruit ~ Root, data = Growth,
	xlab = list("Root Biomass",cex = 1), # reset size to default of 1
	ylab = list("Fruit Production",cex = 1), # reset size to default of 1
	cex = 2, pch = 21, bg = culr) # add culr object to the bg call

# we could have done it differently using the c() function....and then selecting the variable
culr <- c("green", "red")
culr[Growth$Grazing]
plot(Fruit ~ Root, data = Growth,
	xlab = list("Root Biomass",cex = 1),
	ylab = list("Fruit Production",cex = 1),
	cex = 2, pch = 21, bg = culr[Grazing]) # adds the selection to the colour!

# now let's finish the graphic by adding a legend
legend("topleft", legend = c("Grazed", "Ungrazed"),
	pch = 21, pt.bg = c("Green", "Red"), pt.cex = 2)

# Repeat in ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Growth, aes(x=Root, y=Fruit, colour = Grazing)) + geom_point() +
  labs(title = "", x = "Root Biomass", y = "Fruit Production")
# NOTICE HOW MUXH EASIER THIS IS TO DO!

# CLASS exercise: create a high quality plot      *

#**************************************************

# First linear regression output
# use the Nelson.csv data
# This is an experiment on 9 batches of flour beetles assessing their weight loss measued in mg
# at different humidity levels ranging from 0-93% humidity
# The experiment lasted 6 days

# Load data (you should have already done this)
Flour <- read.csv(file.choose())

# Look at it
str(Flour)
glimpse(Flour)

# Draw some pictures to assess linearity - you've plotted this so you can see it is!
plot(WEIGHTLOSS ~ HUMIDITY, data = Flour,
	xlab = "% Humidity",
	ylab = "Beetle weight loss (mg)",
	pch = 21, col = "blue", bg = "blue")

# You can also generate boxplots for variability using the car package 
#Â which align to the X and Y axes. Super useful
# load package car
require(car)

scatterplot(WEIGHTLOSS ~ HUMIDITY, data = Flour,
	xlab = "% Humidity",
	ylab = "Beetle Weight loss (mg)")

# The boxplot indicate normal distribution of data - it's quite symmetrical
# There is no indication of increasing spread of measured points around the green linear regression line
# So we can assume homogeneity of variance is likely....

# checking assumptions using ggplot2
#QQ-plot for normality. HINT: remember Y axis variable is WEIGHTLOSS (sample = ) and data file = Flour

ggplot(aes(sample = WEIGHTLOSS), data = Flour) + stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()
# You can add confidence intervals and labels if you want

# Run a linear model using the lm() function from base R
Flour.lm <- lm(WEIGHTLOSS ~ HUMIDITY, data = Flour)    # don't mix up your response and explanatory variables!

# Look at the output
summary(Flour.lm)   # refer to lecture PDF to see what the numbers mean i.e. for interpretation
anova(Flour.lm)     # lists the tests on the data of response to explanatory

#So what does this show us?
#First we see our model call usig the lm() function
#Then we have the spread of residuals lists from min (generally a -ve) to positive 
#The coefficients are listed next. The intercept estimate (~8.7) is the point that the regression line passes ths Y axis. Then we have the standard  error, a T value and a significance level Pr (note it's highly significant).
#The next line is your explanatory variable in this case HUMIDITY. The estimate this time is the slope of the line (it's a negative so is slopes down from left to right); the we have the same other elements. Note it is highly significant too.
#The next table is the ANOVA table and it shows that the covariate is highly significant using 1 df (there is only one covariate). And you have 7df of residuals. Which is 8-1.


# Let' look at the model more carefully by analysising the objects (see top left panel in RStudio)
# Or just type:
names(Flour.lm)

coef(Flour.lm) # show the intercept and slope values (or the betas)
residuals(Flour.lm)   # shows the residuals or errors for the fitted values fitted.values(Flour.lm)
# these should not show any patterns if graphed - more on this later in the session
fitted.values(Flour.lm) # shows the fitted values of y for every measured x

# recreate the plot with a regression line
# Draw some pictures to assess linearity - you've plotted this so you can see it is!

	ylab = "Beetle weight loss (mg)",

# Now let's use the model to do something - i.e. prediction
# First we'll calculate the confidence intervals
confint(Flour.lm)

#Now we'll predict the mean beetle weight expected at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% humidity levels

# We're going to do this visually although you can use the tests we introduced last week and earlier

http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/52089/what-does-having-constant-variance-in-a-linear-regression-model-mean/52107#52107

# There is a R blogger post on this as well (not for the faint hearted):

set.seed(5) # use R's simulation tools
N  = 500 # 500 data points
b0 = 3 # set b0 or the intercept
b1 = .4 # set the slope or B1

y_homo   = b0 + b1*x + rnorm(N, mean=0, sd=sqrt(s2            )) # groups points around the line
y_hetero = b0 + b1*x + rnorm(N, mean=0, sd=sqrt(exp(g1 + g2*x))) # increase variability in Y with measured X


# First we compare raw data

4/length(Mussel$INDIV) # K-1 in this case is 1-1 = 0 (as we only have one explanatory variable)
# 0.16 is threshold so observation is 21 might be an issue....I'd be tempted to leave it in. Not a huge issue.

# The car package has clever stuff too....

# You can also look at the Normality of Residuals
# qq plot for studentized resid
qqPlot(mussel.lm1, main="QQ Plot")

# now predict the mean values per season
predictions.levels <- predict(Limpet.lm, newdata = new.x1)
preds.for.plot1 <- data.frame(new.x1, predictions.levels)

# Look at it - it gives you the mean density and mean eggs production
preds.for.plot1

# As always the plot can be generated in ggplot

#Make some new density values to predict at and drop into a dataframe. expand.grid() is a function that generates a grid of numbersâessentially it builds a factorial representation of any variables you provide to it, and returns a data frame. 

new.x <- expand.grid(DENSITY = seq(from = 8, to = 45, length.out = 10))

#look at it

head(new.x)

#Now let's add SEASON in. Recall it has two levels - spring and summer.


new.x <- expand.grid(
  DENSITY = seq(from = 8, to = 45, length.out = 10),
  SEASON = c("spring","summer")) 

#look at it (again)
head(new.x) 

#We will use predict() with three arguments: a model, a value for newdata, and a request for confidence intervals. And we assign what predict returns to an object called new.y:

new.y <- predict(Limpet.lm, newdata = new.x,
                 interval = 'confidence')

#Check it...

head(new.y)

# We have new.x, which looks like a version of the explanatory variables. And we have new.y, which is estimated using the coefficients from the model we have actually fitted, along with the 95% confidence interval around each value, with nice names â fit, lwr, and upr
# The next step Beckerman et al. call âhousekeepingâ; an important part of using R, and at this point in the plotting cycle. To do this we combine the new yâs with the new xâs, so that we have a clear picture of what it is youâve made. We can do that with the function data.frame(). We call the data frame Limpet.addition,âcause we are gonna add these to the plot.

Limpet.addition <- data.frame(new.x, new.y)
Limpet.addition <- rename(Limpet.addition, EGGS = fit)

#Check it

head(Limpet.addition)

# So, now you have a new, small data frame that contains the grid of seasons and densities, as well as the predicted values and 95% CI at each of these combinations. You did not need to specify the coefficients, or the equations for the lines. predict() does all of that for you. You did not need to add and subtract 1.96*standard error to and from each value either to generate the CIâ¦ predict() does all of that for you.
#You are now ready to plot the and use the predictions

ggplot(Limpet, aes(x = DENSITY, y = EGGS, colour = SEASON)) + 
  # first add in the points
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  # now add in the fits and CIs
  # NOte DENSITY and EGG are inherited so don't need specifying
geom_smooth(data = Limpet.addition, aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr,
                                        fill = SEASON), stat = 'identity') +
  # now adjust colours
  scale_colour_manual(values = c(spring = "green", summer = "red")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(spring = "green", summer = "red")) +
  # add theme
  theme_bw()

# Note this way we get the CKs too!!

# PART FOUR: Class Exercises                    *
#************************************************
#1. Datafile = old faithful. It is in the base system already as a dataframe called "faithful". Type str(faithful) to see its structure.
# There are two observation variables in the dataset.
# The first one, called eruptions, is the duration of the geyser eruptions (mins).
# The second one, called waiting, is the length of waiting period until the next eruption (mins).
# Response = eruptions
# Explanatory = waiting
# 272 rows v 2 columns see dim(faithful)

# 2. Use the mussel data (mussel.csv) but with response variable as abundance (Mussel$INDIV)
# not species richness (Mussel$SPECIES)

# 3. Use the compensation.csv dataset and undertake an ANCOVA analysis

#************************************************
# TASKS - repeat on all datasets:
# 1. Create plots to assess the assumptions:
#	(a) On the raw data;
#	(b) Run the model;
#	(c) Validate it.
# 2. Create a final model plot with predicted data, 95% CIs, regression equation, R-squared value;
# 3. Interpret the model output.
