Create a directory on your desktop called 'RWork' (or whatever you want) and download the data and script files from the Canvas website)
Spend the some time reviewing last weeks material....!!!!
Normal run of start up commands

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

INTRODUCTION - Means and variability (see excellent chapter in Crawley's book on this).* 
****************************************************************************************
```{r}
y <- c(13, 7, 5, 12, 9, 15, 6, 11, 9, 7, 12) # create some basic data
plot(y, ylim = c(0, 20))    # plot it as a scatter limiting the axis 0 - 20

# How can we quantify this scatter? We could use the range
range(y)

# But we need something standardised against the mean...

mean(y)

y - mean(y)  # The result shows both negative and positive values (not ideal when we sum it)

# So we square the sum to get the 'sum of squares'
sum((y-mean(y))^2)

# but this value is going to increase everytime we add to it!
# So we need to standardise it by dividing the value by the number of samples

sum((y - mean(y))^2)/(length(y) - 1) # Notice we are subtracting one from the number of samples = the degrees of freedom

# or we can just call the var() function
var(y)

```

************************************************
PART 1: Comparisons of two independent samples *
t-Tests                                        *
use ozone.csv                                  *
************************************************
Load in datafile (use the filechoose command) - FILL IN THE CODE NEEDED IN THE BLANKS...
```{r}
ozone <- _____________
```

look at it to establish its structure and form

```{r}
str(------)
View(------)
```
We wish to know if the two gardens differ in their ozone concentrations
We can use a histogram to show this; it will illustrate the central tendencies of the data
But first we need to subset the data to pull out the bits we need for the comparison. We did this last week with the same data

```{r}
GardA <- ozone[ozone$Garden == "A", ]
GardB <- subset(ozone, Garden == "B") # And the same using the subset function 
```

Make a picture and check the assumptions
Set graphics parameters to give us a 2 row, 1 column plot

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
```

Add histograms with a fixed range for the X axis

```{r}
hist(GardA$O3, xlim = c(0, 7), main = "", col = "Darkblue", xlab = "Garden A") 
hist(GardB$O3, xlim = c(0, 7), main = "", col = "Lightblue", xlab = "Garden B")
```

turn off former graphics device
```{r}
dev.off() 
```

CLASS Exercise 1 MORE assumption checking....(10 mins max) 
(i) plotting a qqplot (use help ?qqplot)# (ii) plotting a QQPlot READ the help file!

```{r}
qqnorm(ozone$O3); qqline(ozone$O3)
```

(ii) using the shapiro-wilks test (use the help system ?shapio.test). READ the help file!

```{r}
shapiro.test(ozone$O3)
```

(iii) calculating the garden variance

You've already done this.

```{r}
var(-----$-----) # for garden A
var(-----$-----) # for garden B
```

(iv) test for heterogeneity of variances using levenes test (You need to load the 'car' library first; then select ??leveneTest)
```{r}
library(car)
leveneTest(O3 ~ Garden, data = ozone)
```

Run a t-test

```{r}
t.test(GardA$O3, GardB$O3)
```
Sometimes it makes sense to store the response variable in one column - so in long format or row-column...
With an addition column that identifies the groups
When data are in this format then we need a different test syntax
This is what we have in our data anyway - look at it

t-test with using a grouping factor

```{r}
t.test(O3 ~ Garden, data = ozone) # Note - the data argument and '~' (tilde) operator (you'll see a lot of this)
```

U-Tests (Wilcoxon tests)
Use these if your variables are not normally distributed or if variances are not equal
```{r}
wilcox.test(O3 ~ Garden, data = ozone)
```
We'll ignore the error for the time being - it is suggesting the use of 
a permutation approach perhaps using the 'coin' package see code below.
Exact Wilcoxon Mann Whitney Rank sum using the coin package
Use where y is numeric and x is binary factor

```{r}
library(coin)
wilcox_test(O3 ~ Garden, data = ozone, distribution = "exact")
```

********************************************************
 PART TWO: Comparisons of more than two samples        *
********************************************************

Introduction to linear models
We'll be using the aov() function to do most of this (both both lm and glm will work)

Single factor Anova
Create the data

```{r}
H <- c(1,2,2,5,6,5,2,1)   					# Create samples
Sam <- c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3) 					# Categorize samples
A.test <- data.frame(H, Sam)				# Create data frame
A.test$Sam <- as.factor(A.test$Sam)			# Make sure sample is a factor - remember we entered as a vector of integers
```

Check the data
```{r}
str(A.test)
View(-----)
```


Draw some pictures
```{r}
hist(Sam, xlab = "Sample", main = "", col = "grey")
```

(iii) Use a boxplot to look at the data structure - Look at the medians in samples 1 and 2!
```{r}
boxplot(H ~ Sam, data = A.test, xlab = "Sample", ylab = "Number")
```

CLASS EXERCISE 2: 
(i) Check for normality, histogram, QQplot, Shapiro-Wilks test

QQ-plot. It needs the sample data to be numeric not a factor so we will change it
```{r}
A.test$Sam <- as.numeric(A.test$Sam) # This command converts the structure to numeric
qqnorm(-----); qqline(-----) # Add in the correct dataframe and column names
```

Shapiro-Wilks
```{r}
shapiro.test(-----$-----)
```

(ii) Check for heterogeneity of variances using a levene test. NOTE there are graphical means of doing this....more next week

```{r}
leveneTest(---- ~ -----, data = -----)
```
NOTE: There is considerable debate over normality tests (see: http://www.r-bloggers.com/normality-tests-don%E2%80%99t-do-what-you-think-they-do/)


Run single factor ANOVA
```{r}
Anova.run <- aov(H ~ Sam, data = A.test)
```

Check results
```{r}
summary(Anova.run)
```

Our boxplot indicated a large difference between sample 2 and others
we can examine the difference between the group means using a posthoc test 
such as a Tukey test - TukeyHSD(add in anova object name)

```{r}
TukeyHSD(Anova.run)
```
Comparisons of more than two non-independent samples

Kruskal-Wallis tests
```{r}
KW.test <- kruskal.test(----- ~ -----)
KW.test # Look at the results
```

********************************************************
 PART THREE: 2-way and factorial ANOVA                 *
********************************************************

Load in data (datafile  = Grazing.csv)

```{r}
Graze <- read.csv(file.choose())
```

Look at it
```{r}
str(----)
View(----)
```

••• !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!••••••••••••••••••••
 IMPORTANT FIRST TASK IS ESTABLISHING WHETHER YOUR ANALYSIS IS BALANCED •
 THIS IS CRUCIAL WHEN USING THE aov and lm() functions  
 WHERE YOU ARE COMPARING TWO FACTORS                                   •
••• !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! •••••••••••••••••••

Check this using the table function
```{r}
table(Graze$Field, Graze$Grazing)
```

You can also 'test' for this using the replications function
```{r}
replications(Abund ~ Grazing * Field , data = Graze)
!is.list(replications(Abund ~ Grazing * Field , data = Graze)) # We're safe !!!!
```

Draw some pictures - class exercise (10 mins) 
```{r}
hist(Graze$Abund)
```

Compare the histograms so separate the fields (needs the subset command)
```{r}
Field1 <- subset(----,Field == "Lower")
Field2 <- subset(----, Field == "Top")
```

Add histograms with a fixed range for the X axis
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(----$Abund, xlim = c(0, 40), main = "", col = "Darkblue", xlab = "Field 1") 
hist(----$Abund, xlim = c(0, 40), main = "", col = "Lightblue", xlab = "Field 2")
```

Boxplots to look at difference of factors
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
boxplot(Abund ~ Field, data = Graze)
boxplot(Abund ~ Grazing, data = Graze)
```

turn off former graphics device
```{r}
dev.off() 
```

We can also combine the factor as an interaction. NOTE the * symbol indicates the interaction
```{r}
boxplot(Abund ~ Field * Grazing, ylab =  "Abundance of Rye Grass", xlab = "Contrasts of field and grazing level", data = Graze)
```

Coplot to look at the interaction of the factors (with added smoother line)

```{r}
coplot(Abund ~ Grazing | Field, panel = panel.smooth, xlab = "Grazing Level", ylab = "Rye grass abundance", data = Graze)
```

Notice how R orders the factors alphabetically on the X axis. Unhelpful because the (High, Low, Mid) are relational to each other - indicating a known order 
Compare the means and errors on a line plot
To do this we need to summarise the data to get the means and standard errors
There are numerous ways of doing this (tapply etc) but we are going to do it using a package called dplyr
You'll need to install it as it won't be there......

Reorder the categorical variable. R plots factorial variables alphabetically - not useful when your factors relate to a quantity of something!!!!

```{r}
Graze$Grazing <- factor(Graze$Grazing, levels = c("Low", "Mid", "High"), ordered = TRUE)
```

Run the two-way ANOVA
```{r}
Grazeaov <- aov(Abund ~ Field + Grazing, data = Graze)
summary(Grazeaov)
```

Now let's consider the interaction between the two factors

```{r}
Grazeaov1 <- aov(Abund ~ Field * Grazing, data = Graze)
summary(Grazeaov1)
```

We can visualise the interaction plot using the interaction.plot function

```{r}
interaction.plot(Graze$Grazing, Graze$Field, Graze$Abund, col=c(2,3), xlab = "Grazing Regime", ylab = "Rye Grass abundance", trace.label = "Field")
```

To repeat the interaction plot in ggplot2 you'll need to generate some summary data (mean, and standard error (se))
Have a go at using summarise in dplyr to generate summary data on the two treatments call it output Grazesum 
(or you'll overwrite your datafile!). You need to group_by factor and summarize for the mean, sd, 
count the number of samples (using length()) and generate the se using sd/sqrt(N)

```{r}
library(dplyr)
Grazesum <- group_by(Graze, Field, Grazing) %>% summarise(mean = mean(Abund),
													   sd = sd(Abund),
													   N = length(Abund),
													   se = sd/sqrt(N))
```

Now plot the interaction plot
```{r}
library(ggplot2) # load ggplot2
pd <- position_dodge(.3)
ggplot(Grazesum, aes(x = Grazing, y = mean, colour = Field, group = Field)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-se, ymax=mean+se), width=.2, size = 0.25, colour = "Black", 
                position = pd) + geom_line(position = pd) + geom_point(position = pd, size = 2.5)
```

Let's check some assumptions using R's in-build plot functions....these do the same thing as your tests (e.g. Levenes) and QQ-plots

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # plot four pictures per page
plot(Grazeaov1)
```
YOU WILL BE USING THIS COMMAND ALOT. PLEASE READ (COPY AND PASTE INTO YOUR BROWSER):

This whole book is a HUGE must read - we have an online library subscription (check the resources tab on the CANVAS page):
Getting Started with R: An Introduction for Biologists
Andrew Beckerman, Dylan Childs, and Owen Petchey

We can validate the data in a ggplot environment too but we need to load a new library

```{r}
install.packages("ggfortify")
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(Grazeaov1)
```

PART FOUR: CLASS EXERCISES                •
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Do the following for all data files:

1. Load in the data and examine it's structure (including experimental balance)
2. Posit your hypotheses (null and alternative)
3. play with some pictures
4. draw a contingency table to figure out how the data are structured
5. Select an appropriate ANOVA-based model (NOTE: we have more than 2 samples...so no t tests!)
6. Validate the model
7. Briefly interpret the results - in your script file!!!!
